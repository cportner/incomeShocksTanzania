# Raw Data

This directory holds the Kagera data by wave together with the survey instruments
and assorted guides to the data.

Because of restrictions on data distribution and size constraints on GitHub you will
need to move this set of data in yourself. 
This is a one time operation since the raw data should not change after that.

The structure should be:

- instruments
- wave 1
  - COMMUNITY
  - ENUM_DTA
  - HLTHFAC
  - HOUSEHOLD
  - PRICE
